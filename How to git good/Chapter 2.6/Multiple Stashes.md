You can stash changes with a message. I rarely use a stash message personally because I rarely have more than one stash entry. I imagine if you keep a crazy deep stash then messages are useful, but I find that I usually stash, and then just a few minutes or hours later, I pop it back out. That said, here's the syntax to provide a message:

```bash
git stash -m "jdsl v0 almost working"
```
