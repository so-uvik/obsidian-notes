# Log Remote

The `git log` command isn't only useful for your _local_ repo. You can log the commits of a _remote_ repo as well!

```bash
git log remote/branch
```

For example, if you wanted to see the commits of a branch named `primeagen` from a remote named `origin` you would run:

```bash
git log origin/primeagen
```
