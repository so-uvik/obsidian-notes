Every dev team will have different standards and opinions on how to use Git. Some teams require all pull requests to contain a single commit, while others prefer to see a series of small, focused commits.

If you join a team that prefers a single commit, you will need to know how to "squash" your commits together. To be fair, even if you don't _need_ a single commit, squashing is useful to keep your commit history clean.

## What Is Squashing?

It's exactly what it sounds like. We take all the changes from a series of commits and squash them into a single commit.
