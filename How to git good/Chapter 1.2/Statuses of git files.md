A files can be one of several states in a Git repository. Here are a few important ones:

- `untracked` : Not being tracked by Git.
- `staged`: Marked for inclusion in the next commit.
- `committed`: Saved to the repository's history.

The `git status` command shows you the current state of your repository. It will tell you which files are untracked, staged and committed.
