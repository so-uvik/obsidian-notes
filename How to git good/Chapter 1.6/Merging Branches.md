# Merge

"What's the point of having multiple branches?" you might ask. They're most often used to safely make changes without affecting your (or your _team's_) primary branch. However, once you're happy with your changes, you'll want to [merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge) them back into the main branch so that they make their way into the final product.

## Visual

Let's say you're in a state where you have two branches, each with their own unique commits:

```
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    other_branch
```

If you merge `other_branch` into `main`, Git combines both branches by creating a new commit that has _both_ histories as parents. In the diagram below, `F` is a [merge commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_true_merge) that has `C` and `E` as parents. `F` brings all the changes from `D` and `E` back into the `main` branch.

```
A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        other_branch
```

# Merge Commits

A merge commit is the result of merging two branches together.

Let's say we start with this:

```
A - B - C    main
   \
    D - E    vimchadsonly
```

And we merge `vimchadsonly` into `main` by running this while on `main`:

```bash
git switch main
git merge vimchadsonly
```

The merge will:

1. Find the "merge base" commit, or "best common ancestor" of the two branches. In this case, `A`.
2. Replay the changes from `main`, starting from the best common ancestor, into a new commit.
3. Replay the changes from `vimchadsonly` onto `main`, starting from the best common ancestor.
4. Records the result as a new commit, in our case, `F`.
5. `F` is special because it has _two parents_, `C` and `E`.

**After:**

```
A - B - C - F    main
   \     /
    D - E        vimchadsonly
```


# Fast Forward Merge

The simplest type of merge is a [fast-forward merge](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_fast_forward_merge). Let's say we start with this:

```
      C     delete_vscode
     /
A - B       main
```

And we run this while on `main`:

```bash
git merge delete_vscode
```

Because `delete_vscode` has _all the commits_ that `main` has, Git automatically does a fast-forward merge. It just moves the pointer of the "base" branch to the tip of the "feature" branch:

```
            delete_vscode
A - B - C   main
```

Notice that with a fast-forward merge, **no [merge commit](https://git-scm.com/docs/git-merge#_true_merge) is created**.

This is a common workflow when working with Git on a team of developers:

1. Create a branch for a new change
2. Make the change
3. Merge the branch back into `main` (or whatever branch your team dubs the "default" branch)
4. Remove the branch
5. Repeat
