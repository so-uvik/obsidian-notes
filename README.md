To use this repository as an obsidian vault on your system, create a new folder and run. ```

```
git clone https://github.com/so-uvik/obsidian-notes.git .
```

Then open that folder as a vault in obsidian, if you're opening obsidian for the first time, there will be an option to open a folder as a vault. Select that folder.

If it's not the first time then go to manage vaults from lower left corner and select the folder to get started.
