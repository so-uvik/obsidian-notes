## What is DevOps?

Before we get started with Docker let's lay the groundwork for learning the right mindset. Defining DevOps is not a trivial task but the term itself consists of two parts, _Dev_ and _Ops_. _Dev_ refers to the development of software and _Ops_ to operations. Simple definition for DevOps would be that it means the release configuring, and monitoring of software is in the hands of the very people who 
develop it.

## What is Docker?

>[!Note]
> Docker makes development efficient and predictable
> Docker takes away repetitive, mundane configuration tasks and is used throughout the development lifecycle for fast, easy and portable application development – desktop and cloud. Docker’s comprehensive end to end platform includes UIs, CLIs, APIs and security that are engineered to work together across the entire application delivery lifecycle.

Put simply: Docker allows us to deploy our applications inside "containers", which are kind of like _very_ lightweight virtual machines. Instead of just shipping an application, we can ship an application _and the environment it runs in_.
