If you've been paying attention, you might be wondering "Why would I ever do this":

```typescript
enum CardSuit {
  Hearts = "Hearts",
  Diamonds = "Diamonds",
  Clubs = "Clubs",
  Spades = "Spades",
}
```

When you could do this:

```typescript
type CardSuit = "Hearts" | "Diamonds" | "Clubs" | "Spades";
```

## Pros of Unions

- Unions are what you use for complex types, so it feels consistent to use them for primitives as well
- Unions don't add any additional runtime code
- It's less verbose to write a union

## Pros of Enums

- Enums are slightly easier to refactor because if you change the value of a label (e.g. "Hearts" to "hearts"), you don't have to change the string literal in every place you use it.
- If you're using numerical enums, then the reverse mapping can be useful _I guess_.
- `CardSuit.Hearts` provides more context than just `"Hearts"`. That said, any good editor is going to say `type CardSuit` on hover, so it's not a _huge_ win.

Personally, I use unions over enums pretty much every time. In fact, Anders Hejlsberg (the creator of TypeScript) [has said](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vBJF0cJ_3G0&t=1012s) that they might not even add enums to TypeScript if they were starting over.
