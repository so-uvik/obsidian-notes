If you've ever heard a Rust enjoyer (and let's be honest, if you know one, you've heard from them) talk about how great the [Rust programming language](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is, you've probably heard them mention "pattern matching" and "exhaustive checks".

To be fair, it's a pretty cool idea. Say we have this union type:

```ts
type Notif = "email" | "sms" | "push";
```

and we have this function that uses it:

```ts
function sendNotification(notif: Notif) {
  switch (notif) {
    case "email":
      return "Sending email";
    case "sms":
      return "Sending SMS";
    case "push":
      return "Sending push notification";
  }
  return "Unknown notification type";
}
```

This might be a very reasonable way to write JavaScript code, but that final `return "Unknown notification type";` is actually redundant in good TypeScript code. The `switch` statement is exhaustive, and TypeScript is smart enough to know that `return "Unknown notification type";` is actually unreachable code, and will give us a compiler error (assuming we have configured `tsc` to do so)!

_Design your types so that you get these kinds of useful errors._
