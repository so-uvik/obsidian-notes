The [`in`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Operators/in) operator checks if a property exists in an object, which is fantastic for type narrowing in object literals.

```typescript
type TextMessage = {
  content: string;
  sentAt: Date;
};

type ImageMessage = {
  caption: string;
  sentAt: Date;
};

type VideoMessage = {
  duration: number;
  sentAt: Date;
};

type Message = TextMessage | ImageMessage | VideoMessage;

function displayMessage(message: Message) {
  if ("content" in message) {
    // TypeScript knows this is a TextMessage
    // because it's the only one with a 'content' property
    console.log(`Text content is: ${message.content}`);
  } else if ("caption" in message) {
    // TypeScript knows this is an ImageMessage
    // because it's the only one with an 'caption' property
    console.log(`Image caption is ${message.caption}`);
  } else {
    // TypeScript knows this is a VideoMessage because
    // it's the only other option
    console.log(`Video length is ${message.duration}`);
  }
}
```

## Discriminated Unions vs. 'in' Checks

You might have noticed that this kind of logic feels _very_ similar to using discriminated unions, and you're correct. Here's the same types with an explicit discriminant property:

```typescript
type TextMessage = {
  kind: "text";
  content: string;
  sentAt: Date;
};

type ImageMessage = {
  kind: "image";
  caption: string;
  sentAt: Date;
};

type VideoMessage = {
  kind: "video";
  duration: number;
  sentAt: Date;
};
```

My recommendation is to prefer a discriminated union when you have full control of the types, but if you're using types from a library or package, or have another reason you don't want extra properties, the `in` operator is a great alternative.
