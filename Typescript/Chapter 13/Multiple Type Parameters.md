There's no need to be limited to just a single [type parameter](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/generics.html#generic-functions) in TypeScript! They're just parameters, and you can have as many as you need (but please don't go crazy).

To _prove_ that `T` is just a random name, I'm going to use longer names in this lesson... but just be aware that short capital letters like `T`, `U`, `V`, etc. are the most common convention for generic type parameters.

Let's create a function that "transforms" its inputs. It takes as input:

- An array of items of type `InputType`
- A function that takes an item of type `InputType` and returns an item of type `OutputType`

And it returns a new array of items of type `OutputType`.

```ts
function transform<InputType, OutputType>(
  inputs: InputType[],
  update: (item: InputType) => OutputType,
): OutputType[] {
  const outputs: OutputType[] = [];
  for (const input of inputs) {
    const output = update(input);
    outputs.push(output);
  }
  return outputs;
}
```

See how long that function signature gets? That's why `T` and `U` are so popular...

If you've been paying close attention, we basically just built our own version of [`Array.prototype.map`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Array/map).

Now we can use our own custom transformers with our custom transform function!

```ts
type Human = {
  name: string;
  age: number;
};

const humans: Human[] = [
  { name: "Eren", age: 15 },
  { name: "Mikasa", age: 16 },
  { name: "Armin", age: 15 },
];

const titanTransformer = (human: Human): string => `${human.name} is a titan!`;

const titanNames = transform<Human, string>(humans, titanTransformer);
console.log(titanNames);
// ['Eren is a titan!', 'Mikasa is a titan!', 'Armin is a titan!']
```

Without changing our `transform` function, we can use it to transform entirely different types of data:

```ts
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
const double = (num: number): number => num * 2;

const doubledNumbers = transform<number, number>(numbers, double);
console.log(doubledNumbers);
// [2, 4, 6, 8, 10]
```
