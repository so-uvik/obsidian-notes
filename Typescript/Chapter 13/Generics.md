Generics are one of TypeScript's most powerful features. They allow you to create reusable logic that works with many types rather than a single one. Think of a data structure like a Queue or a Stack. They can hold any type of data, so it would be really annoying to reimplement them for every type:

- `NumberQueue`
- `StringQueue`
- `UserQueue`
- `etc.`

Generics let us create a single `Queue<T>` type that can work with any type `T`. The best part is that when we use that queue _with_ a specific type, TypeScript won't lose that type information! **Generics are a way to reuse behavior across types without resorting to `any`**.

_You may have already noticed, but TypeScript's utility types are all generics! For example, `Partial<T>` is a generic type that takes a type `T` and returns a new type with all properties of `T` set to optional_.

The `ExampleGeneric<T>` syntax is an example of a generic type parameter. `ExampleGeneric` is the name of the generic type (e.g. `Array`, `Promise`, etc., basically anything that can operate on the various types), and `T` is the name of the type parameter. `T` is just a variable name, we could call it anything, but `T` is a common convention.

## Creating Custom Generic Functions

Say we're building some client-side code (frontend, I know, ewww) and we make _tons_ of [`fetch`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API) requests to a backend server. We might have a lot of code that looks like this:

```ts
async function fetchFromAPI(url: string) {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    return undefined;
  }
}
```

We _could_ lazily leave this as-is, but then it will always return a `Promise<any>`, which has no useful type information. Instead, let's make it generic:

```ts
async function fetchFromAPI<T>(url: string): Promise<T | undefined> {
  try {
    const response = await fetch(url);
    if (!response.ok) {
      throw new Error("Network response was not ok");
    }
    return await response.json();
  } catch (error) {
    console.error("Error fetching data:", error);
    return undefined;
  }
}
```

Now whenever we call it, we just specify the type we expect to get back:

```ts
const comments = await fetchFromAPI<Comment[]>(
  "https://api.example.com/posts/1/comments",
);

const user = await fetchFromAPI<User>("https://api.example.com/user/1");

const posts = await fetchFromAPI<Post[]>("https://api.example.com/posts");
```
