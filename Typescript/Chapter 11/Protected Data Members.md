The [`protected` keyword](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#protected) is unique to TypeScript in that it's _not_ part of the EcmaScript standard. It allows you to define members that are accessible within the class _and its subclasses_, but not from outside the class. It's like "private but also accessible to subclasses".

```typescript
class Character {
  protected health: number;

  constructor(health: number) {
    this.health = health;
  }

  protected takeDamage(amount: number): void {
    this.health -= amount;
    if (this.health < 0) {
      this.health = 0;
    }
  }
}

class Fighter extends Character {
  constructor(health: number) {
    super(health);
  }

  public fight(damage: number): void {
    // Can access protected members from the parent class
    this.takeDamage(damage);
    console.log(`Fighter took ${damage} damage. Health: ${this.health}`);
  }
}

const fighter = new Fighter(100);
fighter.fight(30);

// Error: Property 'health' is protected and only accessible within class 'Character' and its subclasses
console.log(fighter.health);

// Error: Property 'takeDamage' is protected and only accessible within class 'Character' and its subclasses
fighter.takeDamage(10);
```

The `protected` keyword does _not_ have a native JavaScript alternative. I personally don't use it very often. I tend to use `#` private fields whenever possible, or just leave them public if subclasses need access.
