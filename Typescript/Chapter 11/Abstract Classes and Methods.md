An [`abstract`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/classes.html#abstract-classes-and-members) class is a class that _cannot be instantiated directly_. It's a template for inheritance, forcing subclasses to implement specific methods or properties. Say we have this `Shape` class

```typescript
abstract class Shape {
  size: "small" | "medium" | "large";
  constructor(size: "small" | "medium" | "large") {
    this.size = size;
  }

  abstract calculateArea(): number;

  displayArea(): void {
    console.log(`The area of this shape is ${this.calculateArea()}`);
  }
}
```

We can't do this:

```typescript
// Error: Cannot create an instance of an abstract class
const shape = new Shape("small");
```

Within an abstract class, `abstract` methods (like `calculateArea` above) _do not_ have an implementation because the implementation _must_ be provided by the subclass. However, it can still have regular methods (like `displayArea` above) which are then shared by all subclasses.

So, we can create a `Circle` class that extends `Shape` and implements the `calculateArea` method:

```typescript
class Circle extends Shape {
  radius: number;
  constructor(size: "small" | "medium" | "large") {
    super(size);
    if (this.size === "small") {
      this.radius = 5;
    } else if (this.size === "medium") {
      this.radius = 10;
    } else {
      this.radius = 15;
    }
  }
  calculateArea(): number {
    return Math.PI * this.radius * this.radius;
  }
}
```

And of course, the `Circle` class _can_ be instantiated:

```typescript
const circle = new Circle("medium");
circle.displayArea();
// The area of this shape is 314.1592653589793
```

Like `protected`, the `abstract` keyword does _not_ exist in native JavaScript. It's a TypeScript-only feature that helps enforce rules on subclasses at compile time. The `abstract` keyword and abstract-only methods are removed from the compiled code.
