There are several built-in [utility types](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html) that _transform_ existing types into new ones. One of the most useful is [`Partial<T>`](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/utility-types.html#partialtype), which makes all properties of a type optional. For example:

```typescript
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  email: string;
};

// Without Partial
function updateUser(
  userId: string,
  userInfo: {
    id?: string;
    name?: string;
    email?: string;
  },
) {
  // ...
}

// With Partial
function updateUser(userId: string, userInfo: Partial<User>) {
  // ...
}
```

Instead of copy/pasting the type definition, the `Partial<T>` utility type allows us to generate a new type based on an existing one. That also means if the original is ever updated, the new type created with `Partial<T>` type will automatically have those changes!

## Nested Objects

`Partial<T>` only makes the top-level properties optional. For example:

```ts
type User = {
  id: string;
  name: string;
  preferences: {
    theme: string;
    notifications: boolean;
  };
};
```

If we use `Partial<User>`, the resulting type would look like this:

```ts
// same as 'type LooseyGooseyUser = Partial<User>'
type LooseyGooseyUser = {
  id?: string;
  name?: string;
  preferences?: {
    theme: string;
    notifications: boolean;
  };
};
```

The `theme` and `notifications` properties are still required (assuming `preferences` is provided).
