The [`as const` assertion](https://www.typescriptlang.org/docs/handbook/2/everyday-types.html#literal-inference) creates a readonly type using literal values:

```typescript
const colorsConst = ["red", "green", "blue"] as const;

// Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly ["red", "green", "blue"]'
colorsConst.push("yellow");
```

It works great with objects too, and unlike most utility types and `Object.freeze()`, it automatically makes all nested structures `readonly` as well:

```typescript
const configConst = {
  apiUrl: "https://api.cobrakai.com",
  admins: {
    johnny: "lawrence",
    daniel: "larusso",
  },
  features: ["no mercy", "not crying", "winning too much"],
} as const;

// Error: Cannot assign to 'apiUrl' because it is a read-only property
configConst.apiUrl = "https://api.karate.com";

// Error: Cannot assign to 'johnny' because it is a read-only property
configConst.admins.johnny = "larusso";

// Error: Property 'push' does not exist on type 'readonly ["no mercy", "not crying", "winning too much"]'
configConst.features.push("sweep the leg");
```

## `Object.freeze()`

The [`Object.freeze()`](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Object/freeze) method is a built-in JavaScript function that prevents modifications to the top level of an object at _runtime_. It makes the object immutable, but it does not affect TypeScript's type system.

```typescript
const frozenConfig = Object.freeze({
  apiUrl: "https://api.cobrakai.com",
  admins: {
    johnny: "lawrence",
    daniel: "larusso",
  },
  features: ["no mercy", "not crying", "winning too much"],
});

// Error: Cannot assign to 'apiUrl' because it is a read-only property
frozenConfig.apiUrl = "https://api.karate.com";

// This is fine because nested properties are not frozen automatically
frozenConfig.admins.johnny = "kreese";

// This is also fine because the array is not frozen
frozenConfig.features.push("sweep the leg");
```

TypeScript is smart enough to recognize that `Object.freeze` is being called, so it gives us a nice compile-time error when we try to modify the top-level properties. And because `Object.freeze()` is a runtime operation, it will still fail at runtime if a mutation actually happens. It's worth mentioning that in [non-strict mode JS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Strict_mode), mutations of a frozen object are silently ignored, but in strict mode, they throw a `TypeError`.
