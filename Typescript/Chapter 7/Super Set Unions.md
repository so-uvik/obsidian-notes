So we know we can drastically narrow a primitive type like "number" by using a union of literal types. For example, maybe only 3 error codes are valid:

```typescript
type ErrorSlugs = "OK" | "NOT_FOUND" | "INTERNAL_ERROR";
```

This works great if these are the only valid error codes, but what if:

1. Any string can be used as an error slug
2. "OK", "NOT_FOUND", and "INTERNAL_ERROR" are the most common values and we like to have them show up in autocomplete

TypeScript has a hacky way for us to express this: super set unions.

```typescript
type ErrorCodes = "OK" | "NOT_FOUND" | "INTERNAL_ERROR" | (string & {});
```

You might be wondering,

> "Why wouldn't I just use `string` - the set of allowed values is the same?"

And you're right, but there's one subtle difference. By adding `(string & {})`, TypeScript won't change which values are _allowed_. Any string is _allowed_. But it will _still give us autocomplete_ in our editor for the values "OK", "NOT_FOUND", and "INTERNAL_ERROR".
