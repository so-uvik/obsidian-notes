Okay, so here's the quirk that makes me recommend `type` over `interface` in _most_ cases. Declaration merging is, in my experience, mostly a footgun. Sure, it's useful in certain niche cases (like modifying the global `Window` type in front-end code), but most of the time it leads to confusing bugs.

When you declare the same interface (use the same name) multiple times, all the declarations are _merged_. This:

```typescript
interface Spaceship {
  name: string;
}

interface Spaceship {
  engines: number;
}

interface Spaceship {
  lightSpeed: boolean;
}
```

Is the same as this:

```typescript
interface Spaceship {
  name: string;
  engines: number;
  lightSpeed: boolean;
}
```

If you use the `type` keyword instead, you'll get an error that you can't redeclare the type (which is probably what you want):

```typescript
type Spaceship = {
  name: string;
};

// Duplicate identifier 'Spaceship'
type Spaceship = {
  engines: number;
};
```
